### Past Relevant Work (PRW)

## PHASE 5: ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER WORK

### Legal Standard
**42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2)(A); 20 CFR § 404.1520(g); 20 CFR § 404.1560-404.1569**

### The "Grid" Rules (Medical-Vocational Guidelines)
**20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2**
*   Considers: **Age**, **Education**, **Work Experience**, **RFC**.

### Age Categories
*   **Younger Person:** < 50
*   **Closely Approaching Advanced Age:** 50-54
*   **Advanced Age:** 55-59
*   **Closely Approaching Retirement:** 60+

### Decision Framework
*   If RFC allows for full range of work at a given level (e.g., Light), use Grid Rules directly.
*   If **Non-Exertional Limitations** (e.g., mental, environmental) exist, Grid is a framework only; Vocational Expert (VE) may be needed.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Shifts to SSA to prove other work exists.
